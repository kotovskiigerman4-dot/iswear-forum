- Expecting a standard express-session based auth with `/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/logout`.
- Wouter will be used for routing.
- The UI follows a strict cyberpunk minimalistic dark theme, with heavy use of monospace fonts and neon glowing accents.
- All visible headings and labels are processed with a global leetspeak utility.

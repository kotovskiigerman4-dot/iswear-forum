Create a full-stack web forum application called "I SWEAR".

General Requirements:
- Stack: Node.js + Express.js backend
- Database: SQL (use PostgreSQL or SQLite for development)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (or lightweight framework if needed)
- The app must be ready to deploy on Replit hosting and follow Replit's Terms of Service.
- Clean, modular code structure with clear comments.

Theme & Design:
- Dark black/gray UI theme (#0f0f0f, #1a1a1a, #2a2a2a)
- White primary text (#ffffff)
- Subtle dark red accent for highlights
- Minimalistic, cyberpunk-inspired but not aggressive hacker style
- Monospace font (like JetBrains Mono or Courier New)
- Smooth hover effects and subtle glow effects
- All visible forum text (titles, system labels, UI messages, role names, etc.) must automatically render in L33T (leet) style.
  Example conversion:
    A -> 4
    E -> 3
    I -> 1
    O -> 0
    S -> 5
    T -> 7
Implement a middleware or frontend utility that converts displayed text into leetspeak automatically.

Forum Structure:
Create the following main sections:
- OSINT
- DEVELOPING
- Bases
- Cryptography
- Sales & Warranty
- Open Source

Inside the Open Source section, display a static pinned message:
"зачем ты сюда полез"

User System:
- Full registration system (Email + Password required)
- Optional ICQ field (stored but optional)
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- SQL database schema for users:
    id (auto increment, starting from 1)
    username
    email
    icq
    password_hash
    role
    avatar_url
    banner_url
    created_at

- The first registered user must automatically get ID = 1 and role = ADMIN.

Roles & Privileges:
Implement role-based access control with the following roles:
- ADMIN
- MODERATOR
- OLDGEN
- MEMBER

Permissions:
- ADMIN: full control, access to admin panel, manage users, roles, delete content
- MODERATOR: moderate posts and threads
- OLDGEN: special badge
- MEMBER: standard user

Profile Customization:
- Upload avatar
- Upload profile banner
- Editable profile bio
- Display role badge on profile and posts

Forum Features:
- Create threads
- Reply to threads
- Edit/delete own posts
- Admin/moderator moderation tools
- Member counter displayed on homepage
- Display user ID publicly on profile (first user must be ID 1)

Admin Panel:
- Dashboard
- Total user count
- Total threads count
- Role management
- Ban/unban user
- Delete threads/posts
- Search users

Security (legitimate protections only):
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Use express-rate-limit
- Use helmet middleware
- Use CSRF protection
- Use prepared SQL statements
- Input validation & sanitization
- Basic logging for suspicious login attempts

Deployment:
- Ensure the app runs with `npm start`
- Include proper package.json
- Configure for Replit deployment
- Use environment variables for secrets

Project Structure:
- /routes
- /controllers
- /models
- /middleware
- /public
- /views (if using templating)

Make the code production-ready, organized, and clearly commented.
